# Kim's Game, written in React.
For those unfamiliar, Kim's Game is a memory excercise played by many military
sniper units as well as small children as a way to develop their memory's detail.

I liked the concept so I am building a sleek, online version using React and raw
HTML5 canvas draw calls as a small programming exercise.
